# SUPPLEMENTARY LEGAL GUIDANCE FOR MEDICAID FOIA REQUESTS
## Comprehensive Guide to Submitting Freedom of Information Requests to State Medicaid Programs

### OVERVIEW
This document provides essential legal considerations, procedural requirements, and best practices when submitting FOIA requests to state Medicaid agencies across the United States.

---

## I. GENERAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK

### Federal vs. State FOIA Laws
- **Federal FOIA (5 U.S.C. § 552)**: Applies to federal agencies including CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services)
- **State FOIA Laws**: Each state has its own open records/public records law with varying names, procedures, and timelines
- **State Medicaid Programs**: Administered by state agencies, subject to STATE FOIA laws, not federal FOIA

### Important Distinction
When requesting records from:
- **CMS (federal)**: Use federal FOIA, 20 working days response time
- **State Medicaid Agency**: Use state's open records law, response times vary by state (2-30 days)

---

## II. STATUTORY RESPONSE TIMES BY STATE (Summary)

### Fastest Response Times (2-3 days):
- **Vermont**: 2-3 days (fastest in nation)
- **Arkansas, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri**: 3 days

### Standard Response Times (5-7 days):
- **Most states**: 5-7 business days
- **Illinois, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia**: 5 days
- **Indiana, Mississippi, New Jersey, Tennessee**: 7 days

### Longer Response Times:
- **California**: 10 days (14 for unusual circumstances)
- **Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Texas, Utah**: 10 days
- **Delaware, New Mexico, South Carolina, South Dakota**: 15 days
- **Iowa**: 20 days
- **Maryland**: 30 days (longest in nation)

### No Specific Deadline:
- **Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin, Wyoming**: "Prompt" or "reasonable" response required

## III. RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS

### States Requiring Residency:
Only **8 states** restrict FOIA requests to residents:
1. Alabama
2. Arkansas
3. Delaware
4. Georgia
5. New Hampshire
6. New Jersey
7. Tennessee
8. Virginia

**Note**: Out-of-state requesters may be denied or subject to different procedures in these states.

### All Other States: 
42 states + DC allow "any person" to make requests regardless of citizenship or residency.

---

## IV. KEY PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS

### 1. Written Requests
**ALL states require written requests**. Verbal requests are not accepted.

Acceptable methods:
- Email (most common and fastest)
- Online portal/web form (increasingly common)
- US Mail
- Fax
- Hand delivery

### 2. Required Information in Request
Most states require:
- ✓ Your name
- ✓ Contact information (address, phone, email)
- ✓ Specific description of records sought
- ✓ Statement that request is made under state's open records law
- ✓ Signature (if not submitted electronically)

### 3. Specificity Requirements
**Be as specific as possible:**
- ✗ BAD: "All records related to Medicaid"

**Overly broad requests** may be:
- Denied as unduly burdensome

## V. FEE STRUCTURES AND COSTS

### Fee Waivers
Some states allow fee waivers if:

- Limited local funding may affect record-keeping capacity

**FOIA Procedures:**
- Follow local territory laws (not federal FOIA)
- May need to contact CMS Regional Office for federal records
- CMS Regional contacts provided in main spreadsheet

**Challenges:**

## XVI. IMPORTANT REMINDERS

✓ **Check residency requirements** - 8 states require state residency
