A customized version of foiamachine for MPART

## Automation Opportunities Analysis

This repository includes an analysis of automation opportunities for the FOIAMachine platform. The standard version of FOIAMachine has been pulled from https://github.com/cirlabs/foiamachine for analysis.

### Documentation

See **[AUTOMATION_OPPORTUNITIES.md](./AUTOMATION_OPPORTUNITIES.md)** for a comprehensive analysis of:
- **API Enhancements**: Opportunities for programmatic access and bulk operations
- **Webhook Integrations**: Real-time event notifications and external system integration
- **Agent Flows**: AI/ML-powered automation to reduce manual work

### Key Findings

The analysis identifies opportunities to reduce human involvement by:
1. **Automating email processing** (70-90% reduction in manual thread association)
2. **Intelligent status detection** (60-80% reduction in manual status updates)
3. **Bulk operations APIs** (50% reduction in request creation time)
4. **Predictive analytics** (improved planning and success rates)

### Implementation Priority

The document outlines a phased approach:
- **Phase 1**: Quick wins (30-40% reduction in manual work)
- **Phase 2**: Medium-effort improvements (additional 25-35% reduction)
- **Phase 3**: Strategic enhancements (additional 20-30% reduction + quality improvements)

### Source Code

The analyzed FOIAMachine codebase is located in the `foiamachine/` directory.
